This may involve coordinating with various transportation providers, such as trucking companies, railroads, or airlines, to determine the most efficient and cost-effective way to get the cargo to its destination.
        Tracking and monitoring: During the shipping process, it is important to track and monitor the cargo to ensure it is being delivered on time and in good condition. This may involve using tracking software or other tools to monitor the progress of the cargo.
        Delivery: Finally, once the cargo arrives at its destination, it is ready to be delivered to the recipient. This may involve coordinating with the recipient to determine the most convenient delivery time and location.
        Overall, the process of cargo in a logistics and freight forwarding company involves coordinating with various parties and using various tools and resources to ensure the safe and timely delivery of the cargo to its destination.
